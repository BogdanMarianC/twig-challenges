        At Penguins Pants Plus, the tailors have been working really hard
        on the fall collection, and we're helping them out by building
        the template for this page! A `collectionTitle` variable has been
        passed into the template: print it inside the `<h1>` tag!

        fallCollection.twig: ~

            # @TODO Should we move input() function from PHP expression provider to the HTTP one?
            # It's a bit awkward when I use it for Twig files
            assertTrue: input('fallCollection.twig') matches /{{ *collectionTitle *}}/
            failure: I don't see the `collectionTitle` variable. Ensure you added it into the template.
        look_for_text:
            type: http
            assertTrue: css('h1') matches /Fall in love and look your best in the snow./
            failure: I don't see the text of `collectionTitle` variable being printed in `h1`!?

        The fall collection is done! Dapper penguins are practically pounding
        their flippers on our door to get a sneak peek of this season's latest
        styles (this year, it's lots of black and white). Loop over the `products`
        variable and print each inside an `h3` tag.

    question: >
        Which of the following is **incorrect** Twig code:
    explanation: >
        * A) is correct because whitespace - even line breaks - inside Twig code are ok
        (and actually, have no effect!)

        * B) is correct because everything between `{#` and `#}` are comments. So, even
        though this *would* be bad Twig code, it's totally ignored.

        * C) is *not* correct, because the `for` tag must be used with the say something
        tag: `{% for product in my_products %}`.

        * D) is correct because `{% set ... ` is one of the valid "tags" that can be used
        with the "say something" tag. We haven't used it yet, but it's totally valid.
