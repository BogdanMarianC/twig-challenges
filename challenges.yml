        At Penguins Pants Plus, the tailors have been working really hard
        on the fall collection, and we're helping them out by building
        the template for this page! A `collectionTitle` variable has been
        passed into the template: print it inside the `<h1>` tag!

basics_incorrectopentagsmc:

        Which of the following is **incorrect** Twig code:
    explanation: >
        * A) is correct because whitespace - even line breaks - inside Twig code are ok
        (and actually, have no effect!)

        * B) is correct because everything between `{#` and `#}` are comments. So, even
        though this *would* be bad Twig code, it's totally ignored.

        * C) is *not* correct, because the `for` tag must be used with the say something
        tag: `{% for product in my_products %}`.

        * D) is correct because `{% set ... ` is one of the valid "tags" that can be used
        with the "say something" tag. We haven't used it yet, but it's totally valid.

        The penguins will want to get their flippers on these pants as
        *soon* as possible. So, we're passing in a `saleStartsAt` date
        variable that's set to *when* these fresh pants are available. Print
        this using the `date` **filter** and the `F jS` format (e.g. January 5th)

        Look at each variable, one at a time:

        * `color`: This is passed from `homepage.twig` to `_otherTemplate.twig` as `blue`.
        But then, `_otherTemplate.twig` passes a new value to `_thirdTemplate.twig`: `red`.
        The `default` filter doesn't do anything, since this value *is* set.

        * `number`: At first, `number` is set to `5` inside `_thirdTemplate.twig`, but
        the `{% set` call overrides this and sets it to 10.

        * `name`: The `name` variable is *never* set. The `default` filter comes to the
        rescue and prints out `Leanna` as a default value.

        * `food`: The `food` variable is originally set to `pizza` and never overridden.
        Even though it's not explicitly passed in the `include` calls, all variables in
        one template are passed into the included template. So, when we're eventually
        in `_thirdTemplate.twig`, `food` is still set to `pizza`.
